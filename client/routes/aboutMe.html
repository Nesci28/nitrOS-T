          My name is <span class="logoColor">Marc Gagnon</span> and i've been
          coding for almost 16 years in different languages. I even remember
          coding in Q-Basic on my father's 486 Turbo... I studied at College
          Rosemont in the "Analyst Programmer" course in 2003-2004. I don't know
          now, but at this time, the computers over there, were a
          yellow/brownish kind of dinosaurs and we were coding on Turbo Pascal.
          I worked on small and big projects but those were always personnal
          stuff or as a "freelance" for some startup companies. <br /><br />
          I am an ex-military who struggled for a very long to find what I
          wanted to do once I got out of it but with
          <span class="logoColor">nOS </span>, I finally figured it out. I love
          to code and that's what, other then my kids, thrills me everyday. I
          wake up in the middle of the night because I dreamed about the
          solution I needed... I wake up in the morning with a new idea,
          thinking I would have enough time to code it while my coffee is
          brewing, to notice we are now in the middle of the night, 2 days
          later... Talking to my girlfriend about my latest projects and
          knowing, without a doubt, that she didn't get anything out of my
          gibberish... I am a passionnate. <br /><br />
          One day, when I'll come back home, my house will detect me, unlock the
          door, turn on the lights, put the dinner in the over, call me
          <span class="logoColor">Sir </span> and, without forgetting, open up
          my latest WIP project. Wait... can't my rPi do that?... B.R.B.
          <br /><br />
          <span class="logoColor">=> </span>In the last years, I mainly coded in
          :<br />
          - Python<br />
          - Javascript<br />
          - Bash<br />
          - HTML<br />
          - CSS<br />
          - Different frameworks (Angular, Express, Vuejs, etc.)<br />
          - And the list goes on...<br />
          <span class="logoColor">=> </span>While using different kind of
          Databases :<br />
          - MongoDB<br />
          - SQL<br />
          - InfluxDB<br />
          - Postgres<br />
